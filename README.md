Simple lab for starting to use GitHub and submitting your first pull request.

- [Create a GitHub Enterprise account](#create-a-github-enterprise-account)
- [Create a GitHub account](#create-a-github-account)
- [Link your GHE account with your GH account](#link-your-ghe-account-with-your-gh-account)
- [Create your first pull request](#create-your-first-pull-request)

## Create a GitHub Enterprise account

[IBM uses GitHub Enterprise internally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wbxxzDp98c) for various sofware projects, project management, and general inner source development.

By [signing into GHE with your intranet id](https://github.ibm.com/), you'll create an account if you don't already have one. 

## Create a GitHub account

Now, go ahead and [sign up a public GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). It doesn't have to have the same user name, email, or password as your GHE account. We'll link the two in the next step.

## Link your GHE account with your GH account

Click the [GitHub account mapper button](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/open-source/) on the Open Source @ IBM page at on the intranet. Go through the steps to link your accounts.

## Create your first pull request

With that done, it's now time to create your first GitHub contribution! Follow the steps in the [Practice-Pull-Requests](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/open-source/) repo.

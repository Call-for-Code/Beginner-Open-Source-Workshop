Simple lab for IBMers to start to use GitHub and submit their first pull request.

- [Create a GitHub Enterprise account](#create-a-github-enterprise-account)
- [Create a GitHub account](#create-a-github-account)
- [Link your GHE account with your GH account](#link-your-ghe-account-with-your-gh-account)

- [Create your first repo from a template](#create-your-first-repo-from-a-template)

## Create a GitHub Enterprise account

[IBM uses GitHub Enterprise internally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wbxxzDp98c) for various sofware projects, project management, and general inner source development.

By [signing into GHE with your intranet id](https://github.ibm.com/), you'll create an account if you don't already have one. 

## Create a GitHub account

Now, go ahead and [sign up a public GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). It doesn't have to have the same user name, email, or password as your GHE account. We'll link the two in the next step.

## Link your GHE account with your GH account

Click the [GitHub account mapper button](https://w3.ibm.com/developer/open-source/) on the Open Source @ IBM page at on the intranet. Go through the steps to link your accounts.

## Create your first pull request

With that done, it's now time to create your first GitHub contribution! Follow the steps in the [Practice-Pull-Requests](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Practice-Pull-Requests) repo.

## Create your first repo from a template

Ok, now that you've learned how to contribute to an existing project, it's time to create your own repository from the [Project Sample template](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Project-Sample).
